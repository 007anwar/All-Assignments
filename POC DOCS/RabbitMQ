*How To Install RabbitMQ on Ubuntu *

*RABBITMQ:-
-RabbitMQ is a widely used open-source MESSAGE BROKER written in the Erlang programming language ,it accepts and forwards messages. 
As a MESSAGE-ORIENTED MIDDLEWARE, RabbitMQ can be used to implement the ADVANCED MESSAGE QUEUING PROTOCOL (AMQP) on all modern operating systems.
-RabbitMQ speaks multiple protocols. This tutorial uses AMQP 0-9-1, which is an open, general-purpose protocol for messaging. 
-There are a number of clients for RabbitMQ in many different languages. 

*Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) in Brief:
-AMQP is a widely accepted open-source standard for distributing and transferring messages from a source to a destination. 
-As a protocol and standard, it sets a common ground for various applications and message broker middlewares to interoperate without encountering issues caused by individually set design decisions.

-In the diagram below, "P" is our producer and "C" is our consumer. 
The box in the middle is a queue - a message buffer that RabbitMQ keeps on behalf of the consumer.
        
       (P) -> [|||] -> (C)
    producer  queue   consumer
    
    producer (sender):
    -program that sends the messages.
    -Producing means nothing more than sending.
   
   queue(storage):
   -A queue is the name for a post box which lives inside RabbitMQ.
   - Although messages flow through RabbitMQ and your applications, they can only be stored inside a queue. 
   -A queue is only bound by the host's memory & disk limits, it's essentially a large message buffer. 
   -Many producers can send messages that go to one queue, and many consumers can try to receive data from one queue. 
  
   consumer(Receiver):
   -program that mostly waits to receive messages.
   -Consuming has a similar meaning to receiving


   
*Prerequisites
-Deploy a brand new Vultr Ubuntu 16.04 server instance.
-Log into the server as a non-root sudo user.
Step 1: Update the system
>sudo apt-get update
>sudo apt-get upgrade

Erlang:-
-Erlang is a general-purpose programming language and runtime environment. 
-Erlang has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance. 
-Erlang is used in several large telecommunication systems from Ericsson.

Step 2: Install Erlang
-Since RabbitMQ is written in Erlang, you need to install Erlang before you can use RabbitMQ:
>cd ~
>wget http://packages.erlang-solutions.com/site/esl/esl-erlang/FLAVOUR_1_general/esl-erlang_20.1-1~ubuntu~xenial_amd64.deb
>sudo dpkg -i esl-erlang_20.1-1\~ubuntu\~xenial_amd64.deb

*Verify your installation of Erlang:
>erl

-You will be brought into the Erlang shell which resembles:

Erlang/OTP 20 [erts-9.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V9.1  (abort with ^G)
Press Ctrl+C twice to quit the Erlang shell.

Step 3: Install RabbitMQ
-Add the Apt repository to your Apt source list directory (/etc/apt/sources.list.d):

>echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/rabbitmq/debian xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bintray.rabbitmq.list
-Next add our public key to your trusted key list using apt-key:
>wget -O- https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -

*Run the following command to update the package list:
>sudo apt-get update

*Install the rabbitmq-server package:
>sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server

Step 4: Start the Server
>sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server.service
>sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server.service

*You can check the status of RabbitMQ:
>sudo rabbitmqctl status
-By default RabbitMQ creates a user named "guest" with password "guest”. 
You can also create your own administrator account on RabbitMQ server using following commands. 
Change password to your own password.

>sudo rabbitmqctl add_user admin password 
>sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags admin administrator
>sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / admin ".*" ".*" ".*"

Step 5: Enable and use the RabbitMQ management console
-Enable the RabbitMQ management console so that you can monitor the RabbitMQ server processes from a web browser:
>sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
>sudo chown -R rabbitmq:rabbitmq /var/lib/rabbitmq/

-Next, you need to setup an administrator user account for accessing the RabbitMQ server management console. In the following commands, "mqadmin" is the administrator's username, "mqadminpassword" is the password. Remember to replace them with your own.

>sudo rabbitmqctl add_user mqadmin mqadminpassword
>sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags mqadmin administrator
>sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / mqadmin ".*" ".*" ".*"

*Now, visit the following URL:

http://[your-vultr-server-IP]:15672/
Log in with the credentials you had specified earlier. You will be greeted with the RabbitMQ remote management console, where you can learn more about RabbitMQ.

To check rabbitq Version/status:
>rabbitmqctl status

1.Log in as the root user (or as an unprivileged user who has sudo privileges) and open a terminal window.

2.Start the RabbitMQ server using the invoke-rc.d rabbitmq-server command, passing it the start option. For example:

>invoke-rc.d rabbitmq-server start
-The RabbitMQ server process runs as the rabbitmq user, which is non-interactive.

3.To stop the server:

>invoke-rc.d rabbitmq-server stop

4.To get status about the server (only partial output shown):
>invoke-rc.d rabbitmq-server status

5.To check Queue status:
>rabbitmqctl list_queues

*UNINSTALL RABBITMQ*
1.Uninstall rabbitmq-server*

(To remove just rabbitmq-server package itself from Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) execute on terminal:)

>sudo apt-get remove rabbitmq-server

2.Uninstall rabbitmq-server and it's dependent packages

(To remove the rabbitmq-server package and any other dependant package which are no longer needed from Ubuntu Xenial.)

>sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove rabbitmq-server

3.Purging rabbitmq-server

(If you also want to delete configuration and/or data files of rabbitmq-server from Ubuntu Xenial then this will work:)

>sudo apt-get purge rabbitmq-server

(To delete configuration and/or data files of rabbitmq-server and it's dependencies from Ubuntu Xenial then execute:)

sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove rabbitmq-server
